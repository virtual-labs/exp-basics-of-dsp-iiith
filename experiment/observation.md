- The quality of speech is directly proportional to the number of quantization levels ( that is, number of bits used for quantization).Though quantization results in loss of information the human perception mechanism can still get the information present in the speech signal.



- It is interesting to note that even with 16 bit/sample, most of the speech is intelligible. Hence we can conclude that significant information lies in the phase sequence of the signal, even if the amplitude information is destroyed.
