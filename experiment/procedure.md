### Sampling and quantization effect
#### 1: Sampling

   Step1: Select one of the 'Sampling Frequency','Bits/Sample Depth' and 'Language' click on the 'Generate Spectrum' button.

   Step2: Click on the 'Play/Pause' button. Listen carefully to the quality of the signal, in terms of perceived background noise/distortion and clarity or intelligibility of the sounds/message.

   Step3: Change the sampling frequency to 8000 Hz and listen to the utterance. Perceive the change in quality of speech between 24 kHz and 16 kHz, by repeatedly switching between 24 kHz and 16 kHz.

#### 2: Quantization effect

   Step1: Select back the sampling frequency of 16 kHz.

   Step2: Reduce the bits/sample value to 16 from 24. Listen and compare the utterances for the two different bits/sample values.
